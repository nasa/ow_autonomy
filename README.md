ow_autonomy
===========

This package contains a candidate onboard autonomy component for an Ocean
Worlds lander, namely a ROS node (named `autonomy node`) embedding a PLEXIL plan
executive.


Contents
--------

src/plans directory contains the PLEXIL plans.

src/plexil-adapter contains the supporting code needed to run the PLEXIL plans,
and also the ROS node implementation.

See the README.md files in each subdirectory for more information.


Build
-----

See the "Getting Started" section in the parent repository's README.md file,
viewable at https://github.com/nasa/ow_simulator, for complete installation and
build instructions as well as hardware/software requirements.  This file recaps
a few key points and has some supplementary information.

A prerequisite for building and running this package is a working PLEXIL
installation, which has its own prerequisites. The environment variable
PLEXIL_HOME must be set to PLEXIL's installation pathname.

Your ROS environment should also first be set up:

```bash
 source <catkin-workspace>/devel/setup.sh
```

Assumed is this directory filed properly within an OceanWATERS ROS workspace
(see Confluence for instructions).  Build the entire workspace with:

```bash
 catkin build
```

Build just the ow_autonomy package with:

```bash
 catkin build ow_autonomy
```

NOTE: If any new PLEXIL plans (.plp or .ple files) have been added since your
last build, a clean rebuild of ow_autonomy is needed.  See bottom of this file
for instructions.


Start the autonomy node
-----------------------

1. First you must start the simulator, e.g.

```bash
  roslaunch ow europa_terminator.launch
```
   NOTES:
    - to omit the Gazebo GUI for faster performance, add `gzclient:=false`
    - for alternate terrains, other launch files are available:
      atacama_y1a.launch, europa_terminator_workspace.launch,
      europa_test_dem.launch.

2. Next start the autonomy node.  Starting the autonomy node always runs a
   PLEXIL plan.  The simplest version is:

   `roslaunch ow_autonomy autonomy_node.launch`

   This invocation loads the default PLEXIL plan, Demo.plx.  A specific plan may
   be run by adding it to the command line, e.g.

   `roslaunch ow_autonomy autonomy_node.launch plan:=ReferenceMission1.plx`

   The argument given to the `plan` parameter must be a file found in :

   `<ow_workspace>/devel/etc/plexil`
   
   See `plans/README.md` for a description of the PLEXIL plans.


Fault Detection
---------------

A rudimentary version does nothing more than check relevant fault parameters for
each lander operation.  Run any plan you like, while setting fault parameters as
desired (see `ow_simulatyor/ow_faults/README.md` for instructions).  You can
also use `scripts/set-faults.py` which by default sets every fault; edit it as
needed.

Faults are simply reported, as ROS warnings.


Clean
-----

To clean (remove all build products from) just the ow_autonomy package:

 `cd <ow_workspace>/build`
 `rm -rf ow_autonomy`

To clean the entire ROS workspace (not needed if you only want to rebuild
ow_autonomy):

  `catkin clean`
