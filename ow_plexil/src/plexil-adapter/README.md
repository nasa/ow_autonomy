The Notices and Disclaimers for Ocean Worlds Autonomy Testbed for Exploration
Research and Simulation can be found in README.md in the root directory of
this repository.

========

This directory contains C++ classes and code implementing:

 - the interface between the PLEXIL plans (found in ../plans) and the testbeds*
 - the ROS nodes `ow_exec` and `owlat_exec` that embody the PLEXIL executive
 - the ROS node `terminal_selection_node` that provides command-line plan selection

See README.md in the parent directory for broader information, as well as build
and run instructions.

*The testbeds are OceanWATERS and JPL's OWLAT Simulator.  The latter
 is proprietary, closed-source software.
