// This plan "spawns" (asynchonously starts) another plan that does
// the analysis, just for a single instrument for now.  The spawned
// plan's execution persists after this one finishes.  We could do
// more here, such as monitor its execution (e.g. time, energy,
// temperature) and abort it if needed.
